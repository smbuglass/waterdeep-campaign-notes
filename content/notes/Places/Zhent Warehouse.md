title: "Zhent Warehouse"
---
A warehouse in the Dock Ward controlled by [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]]. The gang raided this building when searching for [[notes/People/Floon Blagmaar|Floon Blagmaar]] and instead found [[notes/People/Renaer Neverember|Renaer Neverember]]. 

After fighting off several kenku, we also discovered a young one, [[notes/People/Orphans#Squawks|Squawks]], who [[notes/Players/Freya|Freya]] took under her proverbial wing.
