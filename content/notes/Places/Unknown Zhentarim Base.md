title: "Unknown Zhentarim Base"
---
[[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]] base made up of two towers that has some kind of forcefield around it. We discovered it by going through a portal from [[notes/Places/Yellow Spire|Yellow Spire]].

# Portal Room
There are several other teleporter runes in that room, as well as several chests. 
## Portals
- Zhentarim Sanctum
- [[notes/Places/Yellow Spire|Yellow Spire]]
- The backroom of [[notes/Places/Weirdbottle Concoctions|Weirdbottle Concoctions]]
- A Warehouse in the Dock Ward
## Chests
There are several chests in here which we tried to move and unlock and they seem to be magically locked. We'll need to find a key somehow
