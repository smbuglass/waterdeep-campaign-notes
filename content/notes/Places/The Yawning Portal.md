A bar where several important folk in [[notes/Places/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]] like to hang out

[[notes/People/Volothamp Geddarn|Volothamp Geddarn]] hired us here for our first job rescuing [[notes/People/Renaer Neverember|Renaer Neverember]]

Several members of [[notes/Factions/The REAL Zhentarim|The REAL Zhentarim]] like to hang out here too.
