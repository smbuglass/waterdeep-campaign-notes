title: Central Zhentarim Base
---
[[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]] base made up of two towers that has some kind of forcefield around it. We discovered it by going through a portal from [[notes/Places/Yellow Spire|Yellow Spire]]. In our initial jaunt into the tower, we ran into [[notes/People/Yorn the Terror|Yorn the Terror]], who assumed we must be Zhent and walked around with us before we captured him and turned him over to the guards.

After re-entering it from [[notes/Places/Moonshine Warehouse|Moonshine Warehouse]] we discovered it is located in the South Ward near a dancing statue, and can now access it externally since we got a "DK" amulet from [[notes/People/Agorn Fuoco|Agorn Fuoco]].
# Portal Room
There are several other teleporter runes in that room, as well as several chests. 
## Portals
- [[notes/People/Manshoon|Manshoon's]] Sanctum
- ~~[[notes/Places/Yellow Spire|Yellow Spire]]~~
- ~~The backroom of [[notes/Places/Weirdbottle Concoctions|Weirdbottle Concoctions]]~~
- [[notes/Places/Moonshine Warehouse|Moonshine Warehouse]]
## Chests
There are several chests in here which we tried to move and unlock and they seem to be magically locked. We'll need to find a key somehow
# Library
There was little of value here. Several random books, and when we tried to interfere with any of them the books attacked us.
# House
One of the two towers is attached to a mainly abandoned house. We ran into Yorn in the upstairs section of this house.

Downstairs there is some food storage and a kitchen where [[notes/Players/Tuk-Tuk Tastytreet|Tuk-Tuk]] saw another [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|Zhentarim]]Lieutenant
