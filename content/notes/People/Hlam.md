A hermetic monk that [[notes/People/Vajra|Vajra]] asked us to go get a fortune from. Absolutely trounced us 1v3 in a sparring match before giving us said fortune. The fortune hints at several key details relating to [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|Neverember’s Enigma]].

## Fortune:
*Ommmmmmm... A Grand Game is upon us, and soon it will be time to decide what part of the board you shall play. I see other players… your story is a thin thread that weaves through and around theirs, yet any of them might snip yours off should you prove careless. (deep, slow breath) Ommmmmmm…Four in number, are your chief opponents:

- *A face that smiles, a face that beams, but know not all are who they seem
- *A duplicated evil, biding its time, the serpent's twin awaits his moment to shine
- *In gold and blood, the vile price they'll pay, and gladly so upon the feast day
- *Monstrous greed in monstrous eyes, seeking the same fractured prize

*(deep, slow breath) Ommmmmmm…And what prize do these players seek?

- *Liquid fire pours down the mountain, through the city by the sea
- *A man arrives to rebuild; welcomed, cheered and served, is he
- *'Tis his Enigma that the other players all now seek
- *The Three-Eyed Stone remembers, but that secret it... yet... keeps...(deep, slow breath) Ommmmmmm…There you go, that's all you get. Goodbye.”
