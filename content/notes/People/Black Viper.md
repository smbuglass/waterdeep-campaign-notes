Master thief famous in [[notes/Places/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]], hasn't been seen for hundreds of years but recently made an appearance when she put a knife up to [[notes/Players/Freya|Freya]]'s neck in the middle of the night. She was mad because the potion [[notes/Players/Freya|Freya]] delivered turned out to be poison instead of a truth speaking potion.
