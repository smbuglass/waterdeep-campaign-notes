title: "Ammalia Cassalanter"

Noblewoman who has hired us to try and help uncover the treasure of [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|Neverember’s Enigma]].

# Curse
Her family is cursed so that her kids will die/disappear or something when they come of age, and they only have a year until that happens. They need lots of money to remove the curse

# Trollskull Trio
Hired the [[notes/Players/Trollskull Trio|Trollskull Trio]] to investigate the [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|enigma]] in hopes that the reward is enough money to save her children.

After we recovered the amulet from [[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|Yalah Gralhund]] and the [[notes/Factions/Unknown Drow Fuckers|Unknown Drow Fuckers]], we left it with her for safe keeping. Hopefully she can be trusted :)
