title: "Lord Berenger"

Told [[notes/People/Orond Gralhund|Orond Gralhund]] about the [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|The Grand Game]], which led to him and [[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|his wife]] getting involved.

We don't know much else about him.

>   *Nightal 21st, 1489 DR At the fires of Simril last night, Lord Berenger spoke to me of a curious matter. [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|Neverember’s Enigma]]. It seems that the former [[notes/People/Lord Dagult Neverember|Open Lord]] kept some monstrous secret, and now word of that secret is beginning to spread. There are those who believe a Grand Game may be beginning. I sense in this an opportunity to right the great wrong which has been done to [[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|Yalah]].*
