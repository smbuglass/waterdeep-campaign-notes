A Mindflayer we met while trying to rescue [[notes/People/Floon Blagmaar|Floon Blagmaar]] from the [[notes/Factions/Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]].

After interrogating one of his cronies, they revealed that it was looking for stones pertaining to [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|Neverember’s Enigma]].
