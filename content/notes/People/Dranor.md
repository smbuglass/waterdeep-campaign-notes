An elf commoner and horse racing champion. He earned the ire of [[notes/People/Amon Rosznar|Amon Rosznar]] for having the gall to win a horse race as a poor person.

Was killed by [[notes/People/Rongquan Mystere|Rongquan Mystere]] with a fucking gun.

We discovered his body while we were helping [[notes/Factions/The Dungsweepers Guild|The Dungsweepers Guild]]
