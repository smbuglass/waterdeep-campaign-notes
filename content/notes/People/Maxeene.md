title: Maxeene
---
A talking horse who formerly worked pulling a dray in [[notes/Places/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]]. Has a flower that allows it to talk.

[[notes/Players/Tuk-Tuk Tastytreet|Tuk-Tuk]], upon meeting her for the first time, convinced her to pursue higher goals for herself, she learned misty step from a wizards scroll that she borrowed, and has been on the run since.

Lived in the cellar at [[notes/Places/Trollskull Manor|Trollskull Manor]] temporarily while we looked for a home for her, but has since been rehomed out in the countryside with the halfling farmers we helped out on a previous job.
