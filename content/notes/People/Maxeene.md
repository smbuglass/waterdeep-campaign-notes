A talking horse who formerly worked pulling a dray in [[notes/Places/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]]. Has a flower that allows it to talk.

Tuk-tuk, upon meeting her for the first time, convinced her to pursue higher goals for herself, she learned misty step from a wizards scroll that she borrowed, and has been on the run since.

Currently living in the cellar at [[notes/Places/Trollskull Manor|Trollskull Manor]] while we look for a home for her.
