title: "The REAL Zhentarim"
---
AKA the Doom Raiders. The gang that [[notes/Players/Freya|Freya]] has been working for. Claim to be the original [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]] gang in [[notes/Places/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]], and are not a fan of these new folk ruining the good Zhentarim name.

They claim to be doing things above board and only doing vaguely questionable things.
