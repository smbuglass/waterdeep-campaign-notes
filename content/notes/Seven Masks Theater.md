title: "Seven Masks Theater"
---
A theater in the Dock Ward that is haunted by a friendly actor ghost. We were led here while investigating the murder of [[notes/People/Dranor|Dranor]]

## Trio B&Es
After breaking in we were confronted by [[notes/People/Rongquan Mystere|Rongquan Mystere]] and asked to frame [[notes/People/Amon Rosznar|Amon Rosznar]] for the murder.

We also found the following note, which led us to [[notes/People/Fenerus Stormcastle|Fenerus Stormcastle]]:
>*J, 
>There have been strange eyes fixed upon the [[notes/Places/Fenerus Stormcastle's Home|house of Fenerus Stormcastle]] and flights of black snakes have been seen flocking the skies of the Trades Ward. Greater care should be taken when messengers approach the house, and we may want to find an alternative asset. I leave it to your judgment whether or not [[notes/People/Fenerus Stormcastle|Fenerus]] himself should be warned 
>-K*
