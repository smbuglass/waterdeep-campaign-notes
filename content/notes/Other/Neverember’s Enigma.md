title: "Neveremberâ€™s Enigma"
---
Something to do with [[notes/People/Lord Dagult Neverember|Lord Dagult Neverember]] and the necklace we recovered from [[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|Yalah Gralhund]]

# Involved Factions
There seem to be several factions trying to vie for the treasure that the enigma hides.
- [[notes/Factions/Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]
- [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]]
- ~~[[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|Yalah Gralhund]]~~
- [[notes/Factions/Unknown Drow Fuckers|Unknown Drow Fuckers]]
- [[notes/People/Lord Berenger|Lord Berenger]]?
- Shard Shunners (they rule)


# Amulet
[[notes/Other/A mysterious green amulet|A mysterious green amulet]] was recovered by the [[notes/Players/Trollskull Trio|Trollskull Trio]] after confronting [[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|Yalah Gralhund]]. It has 3 slots where gems could be slotted in. We suspect one of these gems was contained in another amulet that [[notes/People/Renaer Neverember|Renaer Neverember]] had on him when he was kidnapped by [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]] early on in the parties adventuring. We were never able to recover that gem so its likely either them or the [[notes/Factions/Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] have it.

Collecting all 3 gems and slotting them into the amulet is likely the key to solving the puzzle.
