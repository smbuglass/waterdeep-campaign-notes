title: "Moonblade"
---
While exploring [[notes/Places/The Blue Alley|The Blue Alley]], [[notes/Players/Tuk-Tuk Tastytreet|Tuk-Tuk]] found a magical shortsword which turned out to be an elven moonblade. Meant to be bestowed upon the most worthy and exemplary of elves.

It contains all the spirits of those who formerly yielded it, so several thousand years worth of elves were not too happy to find they were being wielded by a humble kobold.

They asked [[notes/Players/Tuk-Tuk Tastytreet|Tuk-Tuk]] to find the next in line for the sword, and found that he was a real fuckup of an elf, so they agreed to let the kobold hold onto it until a suitable elf could be found.
