title: "Unicorn Statue"
---
A fine statue depicting a unicorn.

We procured it in [[notes/Places/The Blue Alley|The Blue Alley]] for [[notes/People/Mert|Mert]].

# Fae Day
During Fae Day, we discovered that an actual unicorn's spirit had been trapped in it, and agreed to help get it out. The unicorn's name is Primora

# Rishaal's Help
After bringing it to [[notes/People/Rishaal|Rishaal]], he discovered that there are two wards competing to hold the unicorn spirit in place, an arcane one and a druidic one. If either is removed without dealing with the other one, it would destroy the spirit held inside. He suggested we try and talk to someone in the [[notes/Factions/Emerald Enclave|Emerald Enclave]]
