Worshippers of the god Bane, the party has run into them a few times.

# Yellow Spire 
Encountered at [[notes/Places/Yellow Spire|Yellow Spire]] where several cultists were trying to do a ritual to convert [[notes/People/Shan Chien|Shan Chien]] into a [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|Zhentarim]] asset.
# Moonshine Warehouse
One Banite priestess was overseeing the production of Moonshine at [[notes/Places/Moonshine Warehouse|Moonshine Warehouse]] before we shut it down.
