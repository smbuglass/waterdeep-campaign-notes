# Letters from Eagle
*O.G.,
We’ve identified the gnome who’s been keeping surveillance on [[notes/People/Renaer Neverember|R.N]]. [[notes/People/Dalakhar|Dalakhar]]. An agent of Lord D. Please advise. 
[[notes/People/Eagle|Eagle]]*

*O.G. 
[[notes/People/Dalakhar|Dal]] must still be acting under the orders of [[notes/People/Lord Dagult Neverember|Lord D]]. No other explanation for the sudden shift of allegiance.

# Orond's Diary
*Nightal 21st, 1489 DR 
At the fires of Simril last night, [[notes/People/Lord Berenger|Lord Berenger]] spoke to me of a curious matter. [[notes/Other/Neverember’s Enigma|Neverember’s Enigma]]. It seems that the former [[notes/People/Lord Dagult Neverember|Open Lord]] kept some monstrous secret, and now word of that secret is beginning to spread. There are those who believe a Grand Game may be beginning. I sense in this an opportunity to right the great wrong which has been done to [[notes/People/Yalah Gralhund|Yalah]].*
