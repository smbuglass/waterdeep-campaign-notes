Note Found on [[notes/People/Avareen|Avareen]], when we captured her at [[notes/Places/Brindul Alley|Brindul Alley]].

*[[notes/People/Amath Sercent|Sercent]]—I have nothing but contempt for what you have done. I don’t know what foul rites you hope to perform, but the more traditional rites of [[notes/Places/Brindul Alley|Brindul Alley]] would have surely wrung any information this broadsheet publisher might have had. Nonetheless, Manshoon’s word is my command, and so I present to you [[notes/People/Shan Chien|Shan Chien]]. May you choke on him*.
