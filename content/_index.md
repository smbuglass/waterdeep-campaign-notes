---
This is a site to host my campaign notes for a personal D&D game running the Waterdeep Dragon Heist premade campaign. If you are one of my fellow players or DM, hello! 
If you aren't, feel free to explore, but there may be spoilers for the above named DND 5e module. None of this is my intellectual property I'm just the note-takey guy.
## Setting
The campaign is set in the city of [[notes/Places/Waterdeep|Waterdeep]] and its surrounding countryside.
### Major Factions
- [[notes/Factions/Grey Hands|Grey Hands]]
- [[notes/Factions/The Zhentarim|The Zhentarim]]
- [[notes/Factions/The REAL Zhentarim|The REAL Zhentarim]]
- [[notes/Factions/Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]
- [[notes/Factions/Unknown Drow Fuckers|Unknown Drow Fuckers]]
## Current Objectives
- [ ] The Grand Game
	- [ ]  [[notes/Places/Central Zhentarim Base|Central Zhentarim Base]]
		- [ ] Try and find the keys to the chests in the portal room
		- [ ] Assault the base after gathering allies in order to get the stone they are holding there
			- [ ] Try not to get fucking annihilated by [[notes/People/Manshoon|Manshoon]]
		- [x] try to find a ring from a lieutenant to get into the inner sanctum
		- [x] Find the true location of the base, and an amulet to gain access
	- [ ] Investigate [[notes/Places/Orb Confectioners|Orb Confectioners]] as a likely front for the [[notes/Factions/Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]].
	- [ ] Investigate [[notes/People/Lord Berenger|Lord Berenger]] to see how he is connected to the grand game
- [ ] Contact the [[notes/Factions/Emerald Enclave|Emerald Enclave]] to try and find a way to free the [[notes/Other/Unicorn Statue|Unicorn Statue]]
- [ ] Keep eyes peeled for worthy elf to take up the moonblade. Hopefully after tuktuk is able to find a shinier more powerful weapon üòâ
- [ ] Diffuse tensions between [[notes/People/Fala|Fala]]/[[notes/People/Rishaal|Rishaal]] so that Rishaal will help [[notes/Players/Higi|Higi]] turn back into a human
- [ ] Someone should probably check out the rumored Bronze Dragon in the Sea Ward
- [ ] [[notes/People/Zardoz Zord|Zardoz Zord]] and [[notes/Places/The Sea Maidens Faire|The Sea Maidens Faire]] seems like he should be investigated as he is probably related to [[notes/Factions/Unknown Drow Fuckers|Unknown Drow Fuckers]]
